# LearningHangul
Small Game I decided to make to help myself learn Hangul, as other games i'd find like this were multiple choice and I found that ineffective.

Hangul characters appear on screen, type the romanized versions of these characters, then press enter to submit your answer. If you get the same thing wrong twice, the answer will appear at the bottom right :)
